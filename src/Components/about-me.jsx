            <p>I've always had an affinity for creativity. Seeing the visions that float around my mind come to life is pure magic. I've worn the hat of a developer, filmmaker, photographer, radio DJ, and a barista. Although the context & execution varies, my drive for each of them comes from the same place in my heart - to make things that make a difference. <span className={styles.noMatter}>(no matter how small)</span> </p>
            <p>Currently, I work as a software engineer at Bloomberg LP. I'm a firm advocate of diversity, inclusion, and accessibility. A few other interests of mine include listening to music, film photography, making various things from scratch, eating apples, and enthusing about my interests.  And, if I know and like you well enough, I'm known to mix a pretty good cocktail.</p>
            <p>I'll leave the rest of getting to know me to you.</p>
